## Overview

The PC Builder AR Experience is a Unity AR mobile project that allows users to select PC components from a catalog and create a compatible configuration. It utilizes Vuforia for augmented reality (AR) functionality, enabling users to visualize the finished build in their real-world environment. The project aims to assist PC gamers in trying out different building configurations, checking compatibility, and providing an immersive AR experience to see how the PC will look and fit within their physical space.

## Features

- Selection Menu: Users can choose from a catalog of PC components using a user-friendly selection menu. The menu includes options for major PC components (e.g., CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, etc.) and offers a selection of different brands.
- Compatibility Check: The project includes logic to ensure the selected PC components are compatible, highlighting any potential issues or conflicts.
- Visualization: Utilizing Vuforia plugin for Unity, the project enables users to view an augmented reality representation of the finished PC build. Users can click on the screen to showcase an animation of the building process, one piece at a time.
- Real-world AR Experience: The AR functionality allows users to visualize the PC build in their actual environment, providing a more immersive and realistic experience compared to static pictures and videos.

3. The project will perform compatibility checks in real-time and provide feedback if any issues are detected.
4. Once the selection is complete, tap the screen to start the AR visualization.
5. Point the device's camera towards a flat surface (a special AR image pattern is needed in order to visualize correct proportions), and the AR representation of the PC build will appear in the real-world environment.
6. Tap the screen to showcase the animation of the building process, observing each component being placed one by one.
7. Explore and examine the finished build from different angles, getting a sense of how it will look and fit within your physical space.
